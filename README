wkhtml-test
-----------

helps us to be ensure wkhtml works as we expect
we recommend to run this test after all wkhtml upgrades

usage:

in one step: run check
   build test environment and start self-test automatically

or

1. build test environment
2. run test
   during running self-test wkhtml is compiled so the test takes more than 20 minutes

commands:

"./wkhtml-test build-environment"   to build docker image contains the test environment
"./wkhtml-test test"                to run self-test only
"./wkhtml-test check"               to build test environment and run self-test
"./wkhtml-test run-environment"     to debug test environment
